# FyndMe Deep Learning Assignment

## Task
You are tasked with developing a model that learns embeddings for both images and text, such that the model can compute a similarity score between matching image-text pairs. The model should take images of digits (from the MNIST dataset) and their corresponding textual representations (randomized versions of the digit labels - see `helpers.py`), and generate embeddings for each modality (image and text). These embeddings should enable calculating a similarity score that reflects how well the image and text align.

- Dataset: You will work with the MNIST dataset, where each image represents a digit (0-9). 
- Model Architecture: You are required to design a custom deep learning model using PyTorch. The model will take both images and text as input, producing embeddings for each modality. 

This assignment is designed to be completed within 4-5 hours. We recommend starting with a simple architecture and iterating as needed.

## Starter Code
Helper function for text conversion and randomization is available in `helpers.py`. Dataloader is implemented in the `main.py`. All you need to do is preprocess data (if you want), create a model, loss function and training pipeline. 

## Evaluation
The evaluation points are as below

- Code Quality and ease of navigation
- Validation metrics
- Input Randomization
- Model Architecture and Loss Function
- Presentation of results
